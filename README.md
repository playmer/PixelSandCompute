# PixelSandCompute

Make sure you've got SDL_shadercross in your path (locally I just have it and it's dlls in this folder but not picked up due to the .gitignore). It's currently prerelease so you can grab pre-built copies from [here](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_shadercross/actions?query=branch%3Amain). Just go to the latest run and download the appropriate binaries. 

Then you can just run the CompileShaders.ps1 script to compile the shaders.
